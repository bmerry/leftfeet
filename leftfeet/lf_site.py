.. data:: genres

  The available genres

.. data:: repel

  A dictionary indexed by pairs of genres (for all pairs), with
  values being penalty scores for putting the genres close together

.. todo:: Resolve the following questions

  - Should Tango and Argentine Tango be classified separately?
  - Should Slow Fox be split out?
  - Should Viennese Waltz be classed as open?
  - Should Samba and Salsa be classed as similar
  - Should line dances be handled here at all?
  - Any other genres (Paso Doble?)
  - Are there special rules for the start (beginner-friendly?) and end (waltz?)
  - How should songs be picked within a genre (time since last use, star ratings)?
  - How should multi-genre songs be handled?
  - Should low-rated songs be picked randomly (but less often), or just not at all?
  - How many entries should be made? Specify a count or duration?
  - How should frequencies be set? Per genre or at a higher level?
  - What settings should be presented in the plugin? Should they pop up on use or just be plugin settings?
