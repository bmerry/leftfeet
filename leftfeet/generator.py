'''
Contains the logic to generate a list of genre choices, given the desired
frequency of each genre. It does not deal with choosing a song from each
genre. It is also completely independent of Rhythmbox, and can be used
from the command line.

The algorithm used is slightly odd. Rather than generating a list sequentially,
appending each new choice to the end, songs are inserted into the middle of the
list as it grows.

Firstly, there is scoring function for a sequence, based on the way electric
charges work. Each pair of songs has an associated energy, which depends on
their genres and is divided by the distance between them. To avoid too much
action at a distance (which also hurts performance), songs further than
WINDOW apart do not contribute to energy. Typically the forces are set up so
that songs of the same (or very similar) genres repel each other, causing them
to be evenly spread out rather than clumped together.

To generate the list, songs are generated one at a time and inserted. The next
song is the one that is further behind the expected number of plays based on
its desired frequency. The frequency goals are thus met exactly (to the extent
possibly with rounding) rather than arising stochastically. The new song is
then inserted into the position that minimises the energy of the resulting
playlist. When selecting a genre or a position, ties are broken randomly,
which gives the playlist some random variation.

Songs may also be classified as having multiple genres. When picking the next
song, a single genre is chosen, and this single genre is used in evaluating
frequency targets. However, the scoring function takes the maximum energy over
all pairings.
