LeftFeet
========

LeftFeet is a Rhythmbox plugin that generates a playlist from the library. It
is designed specifically for a ballroom/Latin dancing society, but could be
adapted to other purposes.

Installation
------------
Simply copy the entire directory tree to the Rhythmbox plugins directory. For
a local user on a UNIX-like system, this is ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins.

Configuration
-------------
The set of genres is hard-coded into [leftfeet/lf_site.py]. To adapt LeftFeet
to your music library, copy this file to the user data directory (for example,
~/.local/share/rhythmbox) and edit it.

Usage
-----
After installing the plugin and activating it within Rhythmbox, an extra
*Generate playlist* item appears on the *Tools* menu. When you select it, a
window appears with a slider for each genre. Adjust the sliders to specify the
relative frequency of each genre, then click *OK* to generate the playlist.
